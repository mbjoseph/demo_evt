Bellow you will find typical RMarkdown syntax which should fill in the columns for the poster from top to bottom left to right. The more information you have the more will be filled. Please let me know if you have feedback at brentthorne18@gmail.com or at github.com/brentthorne/posterdown.

# The largest fires are getting larger

In past decades, the size of the largest fire each year shows an increasing trend.

![](../../fig/figure_1.pdf)

# This can happen for two reasons

## Fire size distributions are shifting

## More ignitions make rare events more likely

Here is a map made to show the study site using `ggplot2`, `ggspatial`, and `sf` and you can even reference this with a hyperlink, this will take you to **Figure \ref{mymapfig}**. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [@middleton_geological_nodate] consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

# We built models of ignitions and fire sizes

1. Easy to use reproducible poster design. 
2. Integration with `RMarkdown`.
3. Easy transition from `posterdown` to `thesisdown` or `rticles`

# We can predict 75\% of extreme wildfires

This package uses the same workflow approach as the `RMarkdown` you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > Latex > PDF.

# We should expect even more extreme wildfires

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calcualated. In posterdown this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical `RMarkdown` formatting. I suggesting checking out the `kableExtra` package and its in depth documentation on customizing these tables found [here](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf).

\vspace{1cm}

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

data("iris")

kable(iris[1:4,],align = "c", caption = "Tables are a breeze with Kable and Kable extra package!", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","HOLD_position"),full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25)

```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.height=4.5, fig.cap='Using ggplot and patchwork to generate a layout of multiple plots in one figure. The iris dataset was used to generate (a) a line graph, (b) a scatterplot, and (c) a boxplot all together!'}

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)

theme_set(theme_gray() + theme_tufte() + theme(legend.position = "none"))

base <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
  
p_point <- base + geom_point()
p_line  <- base + geom_line() 
p_area  <- base + geom_area()
p_box1  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species))
p_box2  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species))

p_line + 
  {p_point + p_box1} +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1) + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "a", tag_prefix = "(",tag_suffix = ")")

```


```{r, out.width='85%', fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Another typical plot using ggplot, this time with a different theme and r code chunk options for fig.width and fig.height.'}

  geom_point() +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepeal Width") +
  NULL

```


```{r, out.width='80%', fig.width=4.5, fig.align='center', echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Another figure showing how base R plots might look on this poster!'}

# Here is some code for people
# to look at and be in awe of!!!!

# The model worked well, but wasn't perfect

There is still **A LOT** of work to do on this package which include (but are note limited to): 

- Better softcoding for front end user options in YAML
- Images in the title section for logo placement which is a common attribut to posters as far as I have come to know.
- Figure out compatiability with `natbib` which wasn't working during the initial set up.
- MUCH BETTER PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION. For example, there is nothing in the README...
- Include References section only if initiated by the user like in RMarkdown.

# TLDR
