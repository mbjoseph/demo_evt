1. VPD
- team fire will ask John Abatzagolou
- John can get these

2. PDSI
self-calibrating PDSI
Palmer Z PDSI - better month to month
- team fire will ask John Abatzagolou
- John can get these

3. Total precip
- original idea was annual and then also growing season
- new idea: two sliding windows, one long (12 mo) one short (prev. month)

4. Maximum temperature
- average of the daily maxima, monthly timestep

6. PET
- potential evapotranspiration, available already from MACA

Littel paper:
- seasonal precip
- pdsi
- differences in grasslands/shrubs vs. forested

ERC and FWI possibly available projected forward into the future


# Other things to consider
Fosberg fire weather index
Burning index
Wind X drought
PET deficit
