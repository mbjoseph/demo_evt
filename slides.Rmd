# Traditional extreme value theory

- **Block maxima**

- **Peaks over threshold**

# Traditional extreme value theory

- **Block maxima**

- **Peaks over threshold**

Both require large $n$


# How to study extremes with small $n$?

**"Metastastical EVT"**

Developed for short sequences of values 

- $n$ is *random*
- parameters $\beta$ are *random*

$$P(Z \leq z) = \sum_n \int_\beta F(z; n, \beta) f(n, \beta) d \beta$$

# Breaking down the MEV equation

$$\color{red}{P(Z \leq z)} = \color{black} {\sum_n \int_\beta F(z; n, \beta) f(n, \beta) d \beta}$$

- $P(Z \leq z)$: probability of a maximum $Z <$ a value $z$


# Breaking down the MEV equation

$$ \color{black} {P(Z \leq z) = \sum_n \int_\beta} \color{red}{F(z; n, \beta)} \color{black}{f(n, \beta) d \beta}$$

- $F(z; n, \beta)$: probability $Z < z$ for a specific $n$ and $\beta$

# Breaking down the MEV equation

$$\color{black} {P(Z \leq z) = \sum_n \int_\beta F(z; n, \beta)} \color{red}{f(n, \beta)} \color{black} {d \beta}$$

- $f(n, \beta)$: probability of $n$ and $\beta$



# Breaking down the MEV equation

$$\color{black} {P(Z \leq z) =} \color{red}{\sum_n \int_\beta} \color{black} {F(z; n, \beta) f(n, \beta)} \color{red}{d \beta}$$

- sum over $n$, integral over $\beta$: marginalizes over $n$ and $\beta$


# Why is the MEV approach useful?

**Traditional extreme value theory**

- Assume large sample size

**Metastatistical extreme value theory**

- Treat sample size as random
- Allow inference even when $n$ is small

# Why is the MEV approach interesting? 

It's the Bayesian **posterior predictive distribution**

$$[\tilde{y} \mid y] = \int_\theta [\tilde{y} \mid \theta] [\theta \mid y] d \theta$$

- probability of new data given observed data

# Why does it matter that MEV = posterior predictive distribution

**Generalizes** the MEV approach to infer:

- distribution of future data
- distribution(s) of functions of future data


# Why does it matter that MEV = posterior predictive distribution

**We can study different kinds of extremes**

- sizes of single fires
- number of fires
- total burn area in a region/state/country
- rates of change among years/across space for any ^


# Why does it matter that MEV = posterior predictive distribution

**We can predict other interesting things**

- changes in fire phenology
- changes in human vs. lightning started fires
- changes in ignitions/burn area due to WUI expansion


# High level model overview

**Multivariate response**

1. Number of fires
2. Fire size (each fire)

**Spatiotemporal random effects**

- areal model (US L3 EPA ecoregions)
- multivariate sparse CAR spatial dependence
- AR1 spatiotemporal dependence



# Current status

1. "Simple" model has been fit/run
2. Posterior predictive checks for

- number of fires
- size of maximum fire
- total burn area

# Current results

1. Posterior checks
2. Spatiotemporal visualizations

(plots)


# What we're missing

Fire ecology

- explanatory variables
- any quirks with MTBS data?
- detection bias across years?


# Ideal covariates

Drivers of **ignition** and/or **burn area**

1. Rasters (can be summarized at different areal units)
2. Model outputs (can project forward to make predictions)
3. Public data
4. Easily accessible
5. Known to affect either number of ignitions or burn area
6. Processed in R or Python
