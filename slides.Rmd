# Traditional EVT

Assumes "long" sequences of values 

(e.g., lots of $N$ in a year)

# Metastastical EVT

Developed for short sequences of values 

- number of data points is *random*
- parameters governing the distribution of size are *random*

$$\zeta(z) = \sum_n \int_\beta F(z; n, \beta) f(n, \beta) d \beta$$

# Fire extremes

Small $N$ $\rightarrow$ traditional EVT fails

**Idea**

Model the following random variables:

- number of fires
- size of each fire

**Inference on extremes**

Use fancy technique: *posterior predictive distribution*

# High level model overview

**Two responses**

1. Number of fires
2. Fire size (each fire)

**Spatiotemporal random effects**

- areal model (US L3 EPA ecoregions)
- sparse conditional autoregressive spatial dependence
- AR1 temporal dependence

# Current status

1. Model has been fit and formulated
2. Posterior predictive checks for

- number of fires
- size of maximum fire
- total burn area

# Current results

1. Posterior checks
2. Spatiotemporal visualizations

(plots)

# What we're missing

1. Fire ecologists
1. Science!

- explanatory variables for number of fires and burn area
- must be summarized at the ecoregion level

# Ideal covariates

1. Rasters (can be summarized at different levels)
2. Model outputs (can project forward to make predictions)
3. Public data
4. Easily accessible
5. Known to affect either number of ignitions or burn area
